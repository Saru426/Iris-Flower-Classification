# Project Title: Iris Flower Classification

## Overview:
This project aims to build a predictive model for classifying iris flowers based on their measurements. It utilizes the famous Iris dataset and implements a machine learning model using scikit-learn. The model is trained on the dataset and evaluated for its accuracy in classifying different types of iris flowers.

## Key Features:
- Uses the Iris dataset, which consists of measurements of various iris flowers.
- Implements a machine learning model for iris flower classification.
- Utilizes scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python.
- Performs data preprocessing, including feature scaling.
- Evaluates the model's accuracy on a test set to assess its performance.

## Project Files:
- `model.py`: Contains the code for building, training, and evaluating the predictive model.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, instructions to run the project, and details about the dataset and model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.

## Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a Python environment and install the project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `model.py` script to train and evaluate the predictive model.
4. The accuracy of the model on the test set will be displayed.

## Dependencies:
- Python
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Results:
The model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying iris flowers based on their measurements.
