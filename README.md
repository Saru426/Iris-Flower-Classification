# Iris-Flower-Classification
This project aims to build a predictive model for classifying iris flowers based on their measurements. It utilizes the famous Iris dataset and implements a machine learning model using scikit-learn. The model is trained on the dataset and evaluated for its accuracy in classifying different types of iris flowers.
